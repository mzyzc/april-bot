# April
A Discord bot that randomizes the nicknames of everyone on a server. Originally created as an April Fools' joke.

## Instructions
Create a `.env` file in the project directory and populate it like so:

`DISCORD_TOKEN='{token-name-here}'`
`DISCORD_GUILD='{guild-name-here}'`

Then, simply run the bot from the terminal!
